# README

## Quick-Start :rocket:

This repo contains two scripts:

- [`bot.py`](./bot.py): to be used on discord to check-in a user manually.
- [`bulk-assign.py`](./bot.py): to be used locally, to bulk check-in a list of users.

First install the requirements, with: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### bot.py

Run:
```
python bot.py
```

On #staff-chat, check-in users with:

```
!assignrole "joana9321" "Attendee"
```
